We'll be following parts of [The Carpentries Instructror Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/index.html), more specifically parts of episodes 2, 4, 5, 17 and 20.

The objective of the workshop is giving you educator a picture of some best practices specifically for live coding, but also about more general aspects of research based teaching practices. This, truly in The Carpentries spirit, will not make you an expert in teaching pedagogy and methods, but may found a base on which you can later on grow if interested.

Some of the topicis covered are quite "Carpentry Workshops" specific but we feel that, nevertheles, they can be usefull in your own teaching environments.

# Expertise & Memory and Cognitive Load

Are you an expert in a subject? Does this makes someone a great teacher or can it be a barrier? How are we as instructors differen from our learner?

We will see how learners aquire skills and advance though disctint stages: from novice, through compentet practitiones, to expert, and how this building of a mental model of a topic has to be taken into accout when teaching in order to avoid the so-called _expert blind spot_ or _expert awareness gaps_.

On a more quantitave side, but related to the learning stages, we'll discuss about what is congintive load and how does it affect learning. We'll learn about the types of memory, do some practical exercises in order to test ourselves, and see some strategies for memory management. We'll also see how fomrative assessments can help to consolidate long-term learning.


# Live Coding is a Skill

On a more directly practical level we'll see why in The Carpentries Workshops do we teach using partipatory live coding and see the advantages and limitations of this practice. Even being a very "Carpentries thing", many of the techniques used can be applied to any "code along" type of instruction.

We'll summarize some of the key dos and do nots of particpartoy live coding, go through our top ten tips for participatory live conding in a workshop.

Folowing this, after the coffee brack, we'll have some practice teaching in groups of three rotating different roles, with each person doing a 3 minutes teaching demo using live coding followed by feedback sharing and general discussion.  
 

# More Practice Live Coding

In this round two of our hands-on session we'll split again in groups and, after discussing the feedback received in the previous hands-on exercise, the presenter should incorporate changes based on it, get the feedback again and reevaluate theirself using the rubric provided for teaching demos.

We'll also use the Etherpad collaborative document in order to share thougths about these exercices and further discuss about them.
