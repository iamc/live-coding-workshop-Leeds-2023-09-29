# Materials needed

 * Laptop
 * Writing materials (notebook/paper and pen)
 * Feedback rubric either printed or digital. See below for a suggested one.

# Overview

During the live coding sessions, we will work in small groups of three participants. Each group member will take turns teaching a brief, 3-minute (timed!) pre-prepared lesson material to the other two members of the group. In each turn, all participants, including (and first) the one teaching, will provide constructive feedback on the demo.

# Preparation Guidelines

In preparation for this session, you will need to create a 3-minute live coding teaching demonstration. You have two options for your demonstration material:

 * Preferably, you can use content from your own materials or lessons, tailored to your expected audience, or, alternatively

 * You may choose a section from the suggested Carpentries [Lessons for Teaching Demonstrations](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons.html).

Remember, this is a concise 3-minute live coding demo. Your goal is to guide learners through the lesson while actively typing on your computer. While participants won't need to type along with you, they will follow your demonstration closely. This practice session will help you refine your teaching skills and receive valuable feedback from your peers.

We will go over this practice more that once.


# Suggested Rubric

See [Suggested Rubric for Teaching Demonstrations](Suggested Rubric for Teaching Demonstrations) for some guidelines and rubric templates we will follow for the lessons feedback.
